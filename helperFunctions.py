    Distance to Agreement between a sample and reference using gamma evaluation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sample : ndarray
        Sample dataset, simulation output for example
    reference : ndarray
        Reference dataset, what the `sample` dataset is expected to be
    distance : int
        Search window limit in the same units as `resolution`
    threshold : float
        The maximum passable deviation in `sample` and `reference`
    resolution : tuple
        The resolution of each axis of `sample` and `reference`
    signed : bool
        Returns signed gamma for identifying hot/cold fails

    Returns
    -------
    gamma_map : ndarray
        g == 0     (pass) the sample and reference pixels are equal
        0 < g <= 1 (pass) agreement within distance and threshold
        g > 1      (fail) no agreement
